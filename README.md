# Bankruptcy in Poland  ðŸ‡µðŸ‡±

Welcome ðŸ‘‹, to the Bankruptcy Prediction Model project. This project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to predict whether a company will go bankrupt based on financial and operational data. The dataset used in this project was collected by a team of Polish economists who studied company bankruptcies in detail. The goal is to leverage this data to build a predictive model that can assist in identifying companies at risk of bankruptcy.
